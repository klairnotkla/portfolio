    <h3>In the whimsical world of dates, 20th November 2011 isn't just any day; 
        it's the day when Clarissa, the 1996 vintage edition, burst forth into existence, and boy, did the calendar never look the same again!</h3>

        <h4>What sets this Clarissa apart, you ask?</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Her family's woes are her constant companions.</li>
            <li>She's a kaleidoscope of personalities, each for a different audience.</li>
            <li>Her perspective? It's so wide, it's practically cosmic!</li>
            <li>She's the supreme ruler of all things Clarissa.</li>
            <li>She's not bonkers; just a splendid mix of silliness and goofiness!</li>
